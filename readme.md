## CONFIRMATION OF FILES

I confirm I have zipped the files in the format of:

│ ├── wireframes
├── website_cocde

---> Yes I confirm

I confirm I have only included files needed to run the application.

-> Yes I only included files to run application

## ADVICE ON SUBMISSION

The `website_code` folder should hold only the files **used** in your project.

Please do not re-submit the `website-images-assets` and `web-site-text-and-data`.  We don't want them back!  It is **LAZY** to include them!

---> all good then =)
---> I hope I've done it okay, since I used th actual template and somehow I broke my website, so creating the folder following the same format has done wonders for some reasons
